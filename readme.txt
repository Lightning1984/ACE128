This library provides support for the Bourns EAW - Absolute Contacting Encoder (ACE) 

http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10001_10001_1164074_-1

This is a small 8 bit gray code rotary position sensor providing 128 unique positions.
It manages this with a single encoder track with 8 contacts spaced evenly around it.  

This is developed against Arduino UNO R3. Untested on other models. 

The code currently supports the MCP23008 I2C IO expander only

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install this library, just place this entire folder as a subfolder in your
Arduino/lib/targets/libraries folder.


Encoder Maps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library comes with various encoder maps to permit different wiring of the pins
between the ACE and the IO expander. These are generated by the included make_encoder
example sketch - copy the serial monitor output to a new .h file in the ACE128 folder.  

12345678 is for the "rising counter clockwise" wiring, which matches the datasheet
numbers and is recommended for breadboard testing. 

Eagle design files are included. These are tested and work. Encoder can be mounted on
rear of board though soldering is tricky, or on front of board either into female
headers, or onto male header after removing the original pins. These need either the
12348765 or 43215678 maps, depending on which way round you mount it.
